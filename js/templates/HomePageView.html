    <p>The main purpose of this site is to host labs/demos for my blog, <a href="http://ExploringSpatial.wordpress.com"
                                                                           target="_blank">Exploring
        Spatial</a>. My blog is where I document what I learn as I explore new technology for my job. It's my personal,
        technical
        journal that that I share publically. Writing about what I discover is a learning aid, and putting it on the Web
        forces me to dig
        in a little deeper than I might have otherwise.</p>

    <p>I resurrected this site layout from my former S-Corp, Byteworks, Inc, which dissolved in 2010 when I went to work for
        Garmin.
        The Byteworks logo is still on the site for nostalgic reasons.

    <p>This site is built as a single-page <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone</a> application.
        Most of the
        interesting code is contained in Backbone Views stored under /js/views/demos. Feel free to browse the code,
        reuse what
        you want, or suggest better ways of implementing a demo.</p>
