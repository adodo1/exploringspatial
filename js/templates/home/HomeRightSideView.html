    <h2>Personal geospatial learning lab.</h2>
    Welcome to my web site. Exploring Spatial is a companion site to my blog, ExploringSpatial (see feed, on left).&nbsp;
    I closed Byteworks when I joined Garmin International, but I've resurrected the web site to host my labs.

    <h2>Labs and Demos</h2>

    <p><strong>Leaflet Javascript Framework</strong> - These demos are simple examples using key features of Leaflet.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#demo1">Shapes and Layers</a> - This example shows layers and shapes. Cloudmade and OSM work great!
            Google Map, not so much. More work to do here.
        </li>
        <li><a href="#demo4">Garmin Connect Style Map</a> - In this example I'm trying to recreate the
            map interface
            used on <a href="http://connect.garmin.com" target="_blank">Garmin Connect</a> using Backbone, Underscore,
            and Leaflet. I'm just getting started.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Online Mapping Examples</strong> - These demos showcase online mapping services.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#demo3">MapBox</a> - This map of earthquakes was generated using TileMill
            as part of its tutorial.
        </li>
        <li><a href="#demo2">ArcGIS Online</a> - This map of earthquakes was created with ArcGIS Online
            for a Coursera course.
        </li>
