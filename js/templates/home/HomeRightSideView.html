    <h1>Welcome to Exploring Spatial</h1>

    <h2>My learning playground for GIS and web development.</h2>
    Exploring Spatial is a companion site to my blog, <a href="http://ExploringSpatial.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Exploring Spatial</a> (see "Recent Posts," on left).&nbsp;
    I closed my S-Corporation, Byteworks, in 2010 when I joined Garmin International, but I've resurrected the web site CSS template to host my labs.

    <h2>Code Repository</h2>
    All the labs and demos on this site, in fact, the entire site, are on GitHub. Feel free to examine it at
        <a href="https://github.com/smitchell/exploringspatial">GitHub, Inc</a> or pull the repository down to your machine
        from the HTTPS Clone URL: <a href="https://github.com/smitchell/exploringspatial.git">https://github.com/smitchell/exploringspatial.git</a>
    <h2>Site Structure</h2>
    The site is built as a single page web application using Backbone.js. Most of the interesting bits are under /js/views/demos. Going forward, I'll provide
    links from my blog to the corresponding Backbone views on GitHub.
    <h2>Labs and Demos</h2>
    Here are a few of the demos that I've built so far. A couple are still a work in progress:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#demo1">Demo 1 - Shapes and Layers</a> - This example shows layers and shapes. Cloudmade and OSM work great!
            Google Map, not so much. More work to do here.
        </li>
        <li><a href="#demo2">Demo 2 - ArcGIS Online</a> - This map of earthquakes was created with ArcGIS Online
            for a Coursera course.
        </li>
        <li><a href="#demo3">Demo 3 - MapBox</a> - This map of earthquakes was generated using TileMill
            as part of its tutorial.
        </li>
        <li><a href="#demo4">Demo 4 - Garmin Connect Style Map</a> - In this example I'm trying to recreate the
            map interface
            used on <a href="http://connect.garmin.com" target="_blank">Garmin Connect</a> using Backbone, Underscore,
            and Leaflet. I'm just getting started.
        </li>
    </ul>
