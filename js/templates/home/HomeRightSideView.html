    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The main purpose of this site is to host labs from my blog, <a href="http://ExploringSpatial.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Exploring
        Spatial</a> (see "Recent Posts," on left).
        My blog is just a personal technology journal where I document what I learn as I explore new technology my job. I've
        found that documenting what I learn in my blog is a good learning aid. Making my journal public forces me to dig
        in a little deeper and be more thorough. I closed my S-Corporation, Byteworks, in 2010 when I joined Garmin International,
        but I resurrected my ByteworksInc.com CSS template for my Exploring Spatial site. I kept the Byteworks logo just because I like it.
        I'm kind of nostalgic that way.

    <p>The site is built as a single-page <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone</a> application. Most of the
        interesting code may contained Backbone Views stored under /js/views/demos. Feel free to browse the code, reuse what
        you want, or suggest better ways of implementing a demo.</p>
