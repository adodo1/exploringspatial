    <h1>Welcome to Exploring Spatial</h1>

    <h2>My learning playground for GIS and web development.</h2>
    Exploring Spatial is a companion site to my blog, <a href="http://ExploringSpatial.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Exploring
    Spatial</a> (see "Recent Posts," on left).&nbsp;

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is a companion web site for my blog, <a href="http://ExploringSpatial.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Exploring
        Spatial</a> (see "Recent Posts," on left).
        My blog is just a personal technology journal where I document what I learn as I explore GIS and mapping
        software for my job. I've
        found that documenting what I learn in my blog is a good learning aid. Making my journal public forces me to dig
        in a little deeper and be more thorough.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the web site is to host companion code examples for my blog posts. Some are nothing more than hello
        world demos straight from framework web sites,
        while others go a little bit deeper.</p>

    <p>The site is built as a single page web site using Backbone.js, so much of code may be found in Backbone Views
        under /js/views/demos.
        I closed my S-Corporation, Byteworks, in 2010 when I joined Garmin International, but I've resurrected my
        ByteworksInc.com site CSS template to host my labs.</p>

    <p>Feel free to browse this code, reuse what you see, or offer comments or code refinements.</p>
