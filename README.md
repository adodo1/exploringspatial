Exploring Spatial Blog Companion Web Site
=========================================

This project contains the code from my web "Exploring Spatial" web site , a companion site for the Exploring Spatial blog on Word Press. The blog is
just a personal technology journal where I document what I learn as I explore GIS and mapping software tfor my job. I've
found that documenting what I learn in my blog is a good learning aid. Making my journal public forces me to dig in a little deeper and be more thorough.

The purpose of the web site is to host companion code examples for my blog posts. Some are nothing more than hello world demos straight from framework web sites,
while others go a little bit deeper.

The site is built as a single page web site using Backbone.js, so much of code may be found in Backbone Views under /js/views/demos.
I closed my S-Corporation, Byteworks, in 2010 when I joined Garmin International, but I've resurrected my ByteworksInc.com site CSS template to host these labs.

Feel free to browse this code, reuse what you see, or offer comments or code refinements.
